## Introduction

These are some of the projects I did during my bachelor degree in Computer Science.

## Projects

### IA

  Developed some games using SWI-Prolog;

#### Technologies
* Prolog

### AndroidStudio

-> Project to explore some basic AndroidStudio functionalities;

### AssemblyProject

-> Program in Assembly to simulate a processor with basic functionalities;

### Computer Granphics

-> I explore 4 different tools for graphic design: Three.js, Canvas2D, SVG and x3dom;

### Computer Networks

-> Build an online chat with games and files transfer. The two versions were developed in Java (Client and Server);

### Data Structure and Algorithms

-> Explore some data structures and alghorithms in Java to improve performance (Binary Tree, Linked List, Hash Tables);

### DataBase

-> Querys for PostGreSQL;

### Distributed Systems

-> Two programs, a Server to manage races participant and times, and a sensor to keep track of the time that o point is cross;

### Java Inicial Porject

-> Vendig Machine to know the bases of Java

### Machine Learning

-> First project to make a DecisionTree in python. Second one was focused on Jupiter Notebook and Data, using python and some libraries to explore a set of csv data and ML algorithms;

### Operating Systems

-> Simulate an Operating System model using C;

### Prolog

-> Prolog program to solve a NxN Sudoku game;

### Software Development Methodologies

-> Two Java projects to make an internship management program and a program to make articles;

### Web Technologies

-> Explore html, css and Java using the SpringBoot framework to build an website;
